# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Email Verification System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add email verification functionality to the sign-up process.
# Details:
Email verification system has been fully implemented with the following components:

1. Email Service Abstraction:
   - Nodemailer implementation with Gmail integration
   - Interface designed for easy replacement with SendGrid
   - HTML email templates with DoGether branding

2. JWT-based Security:
   - 24-hour token validity
   - Purpose-specific token validation ('email_verification')
   - Strong secret key implementation

3. Complete UI/UX:
   - Responsive email verification page (/verify-email)
   - Status-specific UI (loading/success/failure/expired)
   - Automatic redirect and resend functionality
   - Full support for 3 languages (Korean/English/Japanese)

4. System Integration:
   - Email verification connected to registration page
   - User-friendly messages and feedback

Technical Structure:
- API endpoints: /api/auth/send-verification, /api/auth/verify-email
- Libraries: src/lib/auth.ts (JWT), src/lib/email.ts (email service)
- Environment variables: EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_PASSWORD, JWT_SECRET
- Documentation: EMAIL_VERIFICATION_SETUP.md (complete setup guide)

# Test Strategy:
System is ready for testing with the following approach:
1. Configure environment variables for testing
2. Test the complete verification flow including:
   - Email sending functionality
   - Token validation and expiration
   - UI states across all supported languages
   - Integration with registration process
3. Verify error handling for invalid/expired tokens
4. Test email template rendering across different email clients
